# Contributing to BackupII

Thank you for contributing to BackupII!

## Bugs

To report a bug, use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/backupii/backupii/issues). Please
check the Open issues, and create a new issue if you do not see a report that matches the bug that
you have found.

Backupii is used with many different systems and configurations, so the first step for us to solve a
problem is knowing how to reproduce it. You can help us solve your issue by including the versions
of Ruby, Backupii and the operating system on the computer that you used.

To submit a bug fix, please [create a Pull Request](https://github.com/backupii/backupii/compare).
Always develop changes against the `master` branch. Read the Pull Requests section below for more
help with preparing fixes.

## New Features

We are happy to discuss requests for specific features. Please check [the GitHub
repository](https://github.com/backupii/backupii) to see if the feature has already been requested,
and create a new Issue if there is not already an issue that describes the feature that you need. A
good feature request will clearly explain the feature that is required, and include a use case.

Of course, if you would like to write an implementation, that is even better! To submit a feature,
please [create a Pull Request](https://github.com/backupii/backupii/compare). Always develop changes
against the `master` branch. Read the Pull Requests section below for more help with developing
features in this project.

## Pull Requests

We use the standard GitHub [Pull Requests feature](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).
If you would like to discuss some details before you start working on a feature or bug fix,
[open an issue](https://github.com/backupii/backupii/issues).

To help us review your code:

* Use the latest version of the `master` branch as the base for your topic branch
* Be sure to use the latest version of Ruby 2 when you write and test your code
* In the comment box for your pull request, specify the operating system(s) and Ruby version that you have tested your code on
* Write [clear commit messages](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/):
the first line should be 50 characters or less, and be a clear summary of the commit, e.g. "Fix
Nokogiri compile issue on macOS Sierra, GH #305".
