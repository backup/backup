  # Rackspace Cloud Files [Syncer]
  #
  # Available Auth URLs:
  #
  #  - https://auth.api.rackspacecloud.com     (US - Default)
  #  - https://lon.auth.api.rackspacecloud.com (UK)
  #
  # Servicenet:
  #
  #  Set this to 'true' if Backup runs on a Rackspace server. It will avoid
  #  transfer charges and it's more performant.
  #
  # Mirroring:
  #
  #  When enabled it will keep an exact mirror of your filesystem on Cloud Files. This means
  #  that when you remove a file from the filesystem, it will also remote it from Cloud Files.
  #
  # Concurrency (concurrency_using):
  #
  #  - :threads (recommended)
  #  - :processes
  #  - false
  #
  #  Threads are a good choice for such sync operations and doesn't consume any additional memory.
  #  Using :processes is discouraged as it's likely to consumes a lot of memory.
  #
  # Concurrency (concurrency_level):
  #
  #  Defaults to 2, the higher the level, the faster it will sync.
  #  If you want a high concurrency level (>2), use :threads and not :processes.
