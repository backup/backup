> This project is a fork of the excellent but un-maintained backup gem.

BackupII is a system utility for Linux and Mac OS X, distributed as a
RubyGem, that allows you to easily perform backup operations. It
provides an elegant DSL in Ruby for _modeling_ your backups. BackupII
has built-in support for various databases, storage
protocols/services, syncers, compressors, encryptors and notifiers
which you can mix and match. It was built with modularity,
extensibility and simplicity in mind.
